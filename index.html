                <p>Welcome to the maZe of the undead. Beware that once you enter you will die.....eventually
                    You are the lone survivor in this mad world and all you have to defend yourself with is your
                    pistol These Zombies are not like the slow moving walkers from the walking dead, no these zombies are predators</p>
                <p>And you are their prey.....</p>
                <p>You are currently trapped in a maze. There is ammo, health, and burgers scattered about the map
                    Your Health will always slowly heal as well as your stamina for sprinting. Eat more burgers to
                    run for extended periods of time or try and wait for your sprint bar to raise up. you will need
                    it, these zombies are fast! You should always shoot zombies coming your way but be mindful of ammo.
                    the careless player will run out of ammo then stamina trying to run away and finally health as the
                    zombies overtake you. Careful players will take careful shots and use the walls as their advantage
                    blocking zombies from your body. Be careful in the maze but know this. Zombies can drop supplies
                    and health and in the rare occasion a zombie may even have a map or a gps to help you find your way
                    out. Get both unless you wish to guaruntee your demise.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Now about the game.....</p>
                <p>Theres only one way out and its the farthest point away from where you start,
                    the bottom right corner of the maZe. When you reach the end you may click and
                    begin another round but the maze will grow as your sanity fades there is no true
                    end to the game, you simply try and clear as many mazelevels as possible until you
                    can no longer survive.</p>
